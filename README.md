A light social network which help you maintain your past, strengthen your present and discover your future.

> * *Magnet : There are endless magnet lines in the magnet field, each of them has different direction and force, invisible but sensible, just like something that connect everyone in this world* 

> * *Relation : Relation is something that around everyone in their whole life, it's so important but we cannot manage our relation effectively nowadays,not merely because it's unmeasurable and untouchable, but we still didn't find a simple but effective tool to help us.*
